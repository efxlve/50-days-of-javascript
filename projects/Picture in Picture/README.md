# Picture in Picture
Picture in Picture is a simple application that allows you to watch videos in a floating window (always on top of other windows) so you can keep an eye on what you're watching while interacting with other sites, or applications.

It's a simple application that uses the [Screen Capture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API/Using_Screen_Capture) to capture a window or screen, and then uses the [Picture in Picture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_API) to display the video in a floating window.
