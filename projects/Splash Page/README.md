# Splash Page
This is a simple splash page created with JavaScript and Figma. It shows a landing page with a logo, a headline, a subheadline, and a call to action button. The design was made by a designer and handed off to me using Figma. I used Figmaâ€™s code panel to get the CSS styles and applied them to the HTML elements. I also added some JavaScript code to make the button functional and responsive.
